Are you tired of all these superficial dating apps that give you matches based on looks or swipes? I don't know about you, but I'd like to know more about my potential lover than whether they swiped me right.

The solution? **CutiePai**

CutiePai scrapes through the pictures that you've posted on social media and generates a personality profile from YOUR pictures. Using your personality profile, CutiePai is able to give you matches that are more likely to have common interests and hobbies.

We hope to connect the world and add some sort chat functionality to the actual match page as you can not directly interact with your potential lovers in the current build.

*CutiePai was built using the Clarifai API, Python with Flask, HTML, and CSS*
